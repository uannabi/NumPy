# EDA with NumPy in Jupyter Notebook

Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using NumPy repository! This project is dedicated to demonstrating the use of NumPy, a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, for conducting effective EDA within Jupyter Notebooks.

## About This Repository

Exploratory Data Analysis is a critical step in understanding and preparing data for further analysis or machine learning modeling. Using NumPy in Jupyter Notebook, this repository guides you through various EDA techniques to gain insights from your data efficiently.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Introduction to NumPy:** Basics of NumPy and why it's essential for data analysis.
- **Data Exploration Techniques:** Using NumPy for data exploration including statistical analysis, data manipulation, and cleaning.
- **Comprehensive EDA Examples:** Step-by-step Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating EDA on various datasets.
- **Visualization with NumPy:** Basic visualization techniques to support EDA.
